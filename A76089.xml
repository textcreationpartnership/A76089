            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat upon your Petitioners Husbands juſt Complaint made to the Parliament in the year (1640) they called him home from his long Exile in the Iſles of <hi>Scilly,</hi> and freed him from his many years cruel cloſe Impriſonment, He then petitioned the Houſe of Commons for Reparations, They refer'd his Petition to a Committee, Witneſſes were examined, and after a full Hearing of his Cauſe in the Houſe of Commons, it was there Reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queſtion, That all the Proceedings of the High Commiſſion Court, Star-Chamber, and Council Board, in Sentencing, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Suſpending from the practiſe of Phyſick, Fining, Pilloring, Cutting off the Ears, Cloſe Impriſoning, and Baniſhing of your Petitioners Husband, were contrary to the Law, and the Liberty of the Subject; and that all thoſe who had ſo unjuſtly ſentenced him, ſhould make him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for his Sufferings and Damages ſuſtained thereby. That troubles coming ſuddenly upon this Nation, the Lords and Commons Ordered no private buſineſs (for a time) ſhould be heard, and that Order being often renewed, put a ſtop to the begun Juſtice in his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners Husband being then imploy'd in ſpecial Service by the Parliament, was taken Priſoner, and for full two years and four months kept cloſe Priſoner in Dungeons and loathſom places for his fidelity to the Parliament, which hindered the further proſecuting of his Petition; but when by way of Exchange he had obtained his Liberty, his Cauſe was preſented unto the Houſe of Lords, where it had alſo a full and deliberate Hearing, and his ſhameful Sufferings (which were ſo cruelly executed that thereby he loſt the hearing of one Ear irrecoverably,) his cruel cloſe Impriſonment, Baniſhment, great Loſſes in his Eſtate (being neceſſitated to ſell his Land, which was your Petitioners Joynture,) beſides the loſs of his practiſe in Phyſick (which before his troubles was very great,) were by ſufficient Witneſſes (ſworn and examined) fully proved. The Lords Ordered, That the ſeveral Sentences and Proceedings againſt your Petitioners Husband ſhould be for ever totally vacated, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, and taken off the File in all Courts where they were remaining, as being illegal, moſt unjuſt, and againſt the Liberty of the Subject, the Law of the Land and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and unfit to continue upon Record.</p>
            <p>That the Lords gave Judgment, That your Petitioners Husband ſhould have four thouſand pounds paid him by way of Damages: They appointed a Committee to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how to raiſe the four thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>That it was Ordered by the Lords, your Petitioners Husband ſhould by the advice of his Councel Learned, bring in an Ordinance to be paſſed both Houſes of Parliament, That the four thouſand pounds aſſigned him by that Houſe, may be raiſed out of the Eſtates real and perſonal, of the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Windebank;</hi> An Ordinance was preſented, paſſed in the Houſe of Lords, and from them ſent by their own Meſſengers unto the Houſe of Commons, where it lay Dormant a long time, but at length it was there read the firſt and ſecond time, and the Houſe of Commons in the Debate thereof (conſidering that your Petitioners Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and his whole Family were utterly ruined by the foreſaid unjuſt and cruel Sentences) refer'd it to a Committee, to proceed upon that Ordinance ſent from the Lords with Amendments and Additions of Names for the raiſing his Reparations out of the Eſtates of all thoſe which that Houſe had formerly voted ought to give him Damages.</p>
            <p>That Committee met, They proceeded upon and perfected that Ordinance, and in their Amendments it was Ordered and Ordained by the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, That for increaſe of Reparations your Petitioners Husband ſhould have five thouſand pounds paid unto him, and to be raiſed out of the Eſtates of Dr <hi>Juxon, James</hi> Duke of <hi>Linox, James</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Hambleton, Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook, Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland, Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet, John</hi> Earl of <hi>Bridgwater, Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> (the elder) Knight, Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> Knight, Sir <hi>John Bramſton</hi> Knight, Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> Knight; or out of the Eſtates of any one of them, as in that Ordinance it doth more fully appear.</p>
            <p>That Colonel <hi>Rigby</hi> Chairman to that Committee was appointed to make the Report and to preſent that Ordinance with the Amendments and Additions of Names to the Houſe of Commons, but in the <hi>interim</hi> he was made a Judg, and (as he ſaid) could not ſit in the Houſe except they called him in to ſit amongſt Them; yet he earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſome others of that Committee to make the Report and preſent the Ordinance; and for that end, when he was to ride the Circuit, he delivered unto your Petitioners Husband all his Orders and the foreſaid Ordinance of the Lords and Commons as it was agreed upon and wrote with his own hands in the Committee, promiſing if it were not preſented by ſome other, that when he returned he would adventure to go into the Houſe of Commons to preſent that Ordinance unto them; but ſoon after his return from the Circuit he departed this life: others promiſed fair, but delayed the performance; in ſo much as that Parliament was diſſolv'd before the full conſummation of our Sute was obtained, and our Ordinance then lay as dead until the Seſſions of the laſt Parliament, to whom your Petitioners Husband preſented his Grievances.</p>
            <p>The Committee appointed by that Parliament for Petitions, took ſpecial Cognizance of his Cauſe, and they unanimouſly agreed that he ought to have five thouſand pounds Damages paid unto him out of the Eſtates of all thoſe, or any one of thoſe, which the former Parliament in their Votes and that Ordinance of the Lords and Commons with the Amendments and Additions of Names, had Ordered and Ordained ſhould give him Reparations: They Ordered, that Alderman <hi>Ireton</hi> ſhould report their Reſult, but before he could make the Report that Parliament was alſo diſſolved.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners Husband then made his Addreſſes unto his Highneſs the Lord Protector, who held it moſt juſt that he ſhould have the five thouſand pounds Damages which was aſſigned him by the Parliament; his Highneſs refer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it to his Council to conſider of a ſpeedy courſe for the raiſing of his Reparations, The Council Ordered, That Alderman <hi>Ireton</hi> ſhould bring in the Report, which he ſhould have made of our Caſe to the laſt Parliament, and upon the Hearing thereof, his Highneſs with his Council, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That your Petitioners Husband for his then preſent ſupply, ſhould have two hundred pounds, which he no ſooner had received, but he was forced to pay it away unto ſeveral men to whom he was indebted: And his Highneſs, with his Council, did then alſo by an Order recommend his Caſe, and Petition, unto this preſent Parliament, that ſo the begun Juſtice of the two former Parliaments in his Cauſe might be fully compleated, and his Reparations confirmed, and ſetled upon him in Parliament by your Honors. Now it hath pleaſed the Almighty lately to put an end to her dear Husbands Sufferings, by receiving him into Everlaſting Happineſs, but the Sufferings, Afflictions and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of your Petitioner, and her fatherleſs Children, are thereb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Now your Petitioner in a real confidence, that that Juſtice which hath ſo far proceeded in her dear Husbands Cauſe, and was always cordially owned by the two former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by his Highneſs and his Council ſo we<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
